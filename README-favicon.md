# Recipe Blog Favicon Implementation

The browser tab title has been updated to "Recipe Blog" and a temporary SVG favicon has been added to the project.

## Current Implementation

1. The browser tab title has been changed from "React App" to "Recipe Blog" in `public/index.html`.
2. A temporary SVG favicon is being used via a data URL in the `CustomHead` component.
3. The manifest.json has been updated with the new app name and theme color.

## How to Complete the Favicon Implementation

For a complete implementation with proper favicon files for all device types and sizes:

1. Use the SVG file we created in `recipe-blog/temp/chef-hat.svg`
2. Go to a favicon generator website like https://realfavicongenerator.net/
3. Upload the SVG file to generate favicons for all platforms
4. Download the package and replace the following files:
   - `favicon.ico` in `public/favicon.ico`
   - `logo192.png` in `public/logo192.png`
   - `logo512.png` in `public/logo512.png`

The application is already set up to use these files through the CustomHead component we've added.

## How the Favicon Implementation Works

1. We created a `CustomHead` component using React Helmet that adds the favicon link to the document head.
2. For immediate use, the component uses a data URL of the SVG.
3. When you replace the physical files, browsers that don't support SVG favicons will fall back to the ICO version.
4. The app component has been updated to include this CustomHead component.
