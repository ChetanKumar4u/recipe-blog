/**
 * This is a helper script to remind you how to create the favicon files.
 * 
 * Steps to create your favicons:
 * 1. Use the SVG we created in recipe-blog/temp/chef-hat.svg
 * 2. Go to a favicon generator website like https://realfavicongenerator.net/
 * 3. Upload the SVG file to generate favicons for all platforms
 * 4. Download the package and replace the following files:
 *    - favicon.ico in public/favicon.ico
 *    - logo192.png in public/logo192.png
 *    - logo512.png in public/logo512.png
 * 
 * The CustomHead component we added will use these files.
